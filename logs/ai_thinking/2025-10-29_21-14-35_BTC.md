### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.80
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 3/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - RSI on 1h at 38.9 (oversold, potential for bounce)
  - Price up 3.8% from recent low of $107,964

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Strong bearish trend: ADX 72.3, price below all EMAs, +DI < -DI
  - Supertrend bearish signal
  - Low volume across timeframes indicating lack of participation
  - No orderbook liquidity or microstructure data

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Strong bearish trend with extremely low liquidity, creating high uncertainty and unreliable signals for trading.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence and high-risk environment. The market shows a strong bearish trend with ADX 72.3, price below all EMAs, and Supertrend bearish, but momentum is mixed with RSI oversold on 1h yet no confirmation from MACD. Critically, volume is extremely low across timeframes (e.g., 1h volume $0), indicating lack of trader conviction and unreliable signals. Orderbook and microstructure data are missing, funding is neutral, and open interest is zero, all contributing to an unpredictable setup. Without clear support/resistance levels, volume confirmation, or order flow signals, the risk-reward is unfavorable. The dominant narrative is a bearish trend with low liquidity, making any trade prone to high slippage and erratic moves. Confidence is low (0.3) as data quality is poor, and fewer than 4 confluence factors are present.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases with price breaking above EMA 20 (~$114,219) and Supertrend turns bullish, consider long entry with confirmation. If price breaks below recent low of $107,964, reinforce bearish view but avoid trading due to low liquidity.",
  "if_breakout": "If bullish breakout occurs with volume, wait for retest of support (e.g., VWAP at $113,639.51) for potential long. If bearish breakout, monitor for liquidation clusters but avoid shorts without data.",
  "if_ranging": "If price consolidates between $107,964 and $116,402 with no volume, remain in HOLD; only trade if clear breakout with volume confluence emerges."
}

## 📍 Monitoring Points
- Watch for volume spikes above average levels
- Monitor RSI for divergence or sustained oversold/overbought conditions
- Check for emergence of orderbook data and funding rate changes
- Observe price action relative to EMAs and Supertrend for trend shifts
- Track BTC correlation and broader market sentiment

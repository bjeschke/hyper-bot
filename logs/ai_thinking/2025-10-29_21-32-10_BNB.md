## 🧠 AI Reasoning Process

### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.80
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 2/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - Price above EMA20 suggesting minor support
  - OBV in uptrend despite negative value
  - 24h price up 1.47% from low

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Strong bearish trend (ADX high, -DI > +DI)
  - Price below Supertrend and key EMAs
  - Extremely low volume indicating weak momentum

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Bearish trend dominance with no volume confirmation, leading to indecision.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

No clear liquidity grab or trade setup due to low confluence (2/11). Market is in a strong bearish trend (ADX 57.5, -DI > +DI), but momentum is neutral (RSI ~50, MACD flat) and volume is negligible, indicating lack of participation. Price is near 1h high resistance at $1118.30, but with no orderbook depth or volume confirmation, risk/reward is unfavorable. Hold until clearer signals emerge, such as volume increase or breakout from key levels.

## üí≠ Detailed Reasoning

Insufficient confluence for any trading decision. The market is in a ranging regime with low volatility and no clear trend, as indicated by ADX of 4.9 and flat price action across timeframes. Volume is nearly zero, suggesting lack of participant interest and no confirmation for moves. Technical indicators are mixed: RSI on 5m is oversold, but longer timeframes show neutrality, and MACD is flat. EMA alignment is not bullish or bearish, and Supertrend is bearish but without follow-through. Hyperliquid-specific factors like funding and OI are neutral, providing no edge. With only 2 confluence factors out of a required minimum of 4, and confidence below 0.60, the prudent action is to HOLD and wait for clearer signals, such as volume increase, trend confirmation, or breakout from the $3969.70-$4081.10 range.

## üîÆ Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases with a breakout above $4081.10, consider long setups with confluence; if breakdown below $3969.70, look for short opportunities.",
  "if_breakout": "Wait for confirmation with volume and indicator alignment before entering any position to avoid false breakouts.",
  "if_ranging": "Continue holding until a clear trend emerges; avoid trading in low-volume, choppy conditions to prevent whipsaws."

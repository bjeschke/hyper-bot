## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

SHORT setup with moderate confluence (6/11). Strong bearish trend confirmed by ADX 57.5 and -DI dominance. Price is below key VWAP and near Bollinger Band upper resistance at $1121.85. Low volume suggests weak bullish momentum. Entry at $1117.35, SL at $1122 (above BB upper), TP1 at $1100 (next support). R:R ~3.5:1 after costs. Market regime trending bear supports short bias.

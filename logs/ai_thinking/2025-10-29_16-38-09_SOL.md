### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.70
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 4/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - RSI 26.1 on 5m indicates potential oversold bounce
  - Price near 24h low of $193.47 could act as support

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Supertrend bearish signal
  - ADX 44.0 with -DI > +DI confirming bearish trend
  - Price below all EMAs (20, 50, 200)
  - OBV downtrend and low volume ratio

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Bearish trend with weak volume and no clear entry signals due to missing microstructure data and poor risk-reward.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

Insufficient confluence for a trade decision. The market is in a TRENDING_BEAR regime with strong ADX (44.0) and bearish Supertrend, but key issues include: 1) Low volume (0.36x average) and OBV downtrend suggest weak participation, 2) Mixed momentum with RSI oversold on 5m but neutral on higher timeframes and flat MACD, 3) No orderbook or microstructure data to validate entries or exits, 4) Risk-reward ratio is poor; for example, a short entry at $196.16 with stop at $198.0 (VWAP) and target at $193.47 (24h low) yields R:R of ~1.46, below the minimum 2.0 threshold. Additionally, the price is trading in a range between $193.47 and $203.50 with no clear breakout or breakdown, and Hyperliquid-specific factors like funding and OI are neutral, providing no edge. With only 4 out of 11 confluence factors and low confidence, HOLD is the prudent choice to avoid forced trades in choppy conditions.

## 🎯 Suggested Action

**Type**: HOLD
**Side**: NONE
**Size**: 0% of position
**Entry Price**: $0.00

**Stop Loss**:
- Price: $0.00
- Risk: 0.00%
- Rationale: N/A

**Take Profit Targets**:
  - No targets specified

**Execution Notes**: Monitor for increased volume, breakout above $198 (VWAP) for long or breakdown below $194.38 (1h low) for short, and improvements in orderbook data. Avoid trading until confluence improves.

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk**: HIGH
**Edge Quality**: 20.00%
**Risk/Reward Ratio**: 0.00
**Expected Value**: 0.00%
**Liquidity Check**: FAIL
**Slippage Estimate**: 50.00%

**Risk Factors**:
  - Low volume and weak order flow increase slippage and false signal risk
  - Missing orderbook data prevents accurate liquidity assessment
  - Poor risk-reward ratio below 2.0
  - Bearish trend could accelerate without confirmation

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If price breaks above $198 (VWAP) with volume, consider long setup with stop below $194.38. If bearish trend continues with breakdown below $193.47, reassess for short entry with improved confluence.",
  "if_breakout": "If bullish breakout occurs with volume spike and RSI recovery above 50, wait for retest of $198 for long entry. If bearish breakout below $193.47, monitor for short opportunities with stop above $196.",
  "if_ranging": "If price remains between $194 and $198 for extended period, avoid trading and wait for volatility expansion or regime change."
}

## 📍 Monitoring Points
- Watch for volume increase above 1.0x average
- Monitor RSI on 1h and 4h for cross above 50 or divergence
- Check for orderbook data updates and funding rate changes
- Observe price action around key levels: $194.38 (support) and $198 (resistance)
- Track CVD and OBV for trend confirmation

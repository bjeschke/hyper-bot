## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence and poor data quality. Market is in a ranging regime with ADX 4.9 showing no trend strength. Volume is critically low (near zero across timeframes), indicating lack of participant interest and unreliable signals. Technical indicators are mixed: RSI on 5m is extremely oversold at 10.0, suggesting a potential bounce, but without volume confirmation or trend alignment, this is high-risk. Price is below key EMAs (20 and 50) but above EMA 200, and Supertrend is bearish, yet ADX is too weak for a clear direction. Hyperliquid-specific factors like funding and OI are neutral, providing no edge. Missing detailed chart history, orderbook data, and liquidity make risk/reward calculation unreliable. Confluence score of 2 falls below the minimum threshold of 4 for a trade. In such low-volatility, low-volume environments, the probability of false signals is high, and capital preservation is prioritized.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases with a clear breakout above $4081.10 or below $3969.70, reassess for trend-following setups.",
  "if_breakout": "If price breaks above $4081.10 with volume, consider long with stop below recent low. If breaks below $3969.70, consider short with stop above recent high.",

### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.85
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 2/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - RSI levels in oversold territory (36-41)
  - OBV showing uptrend (though volume is negligible)
  - Price near 24h low (111406.00), potential support

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Strong bearish trend (EMA alignment, Supertrend bearish, ADX 65.4 with -DI > +DI)
  - Extremely low volume across timeframes, indicating lack of conviction
  - Empty orderbook and no liquidity data
  - Price down 3.60% in 24h, showing selling pressure
  - No bullish divergence in MACD or RSI

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Bearish trend dominance in an illiquid market with no reliable signals for entry; avoidance recommended due to data unreliability and high risk.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence and poor data quality. Market is in a strong bearish regime (ADX 65.4, -DI dominant, EMAs aligned bearishly), but volume is critically low across all timeframes (e.g., 1h volume $1), indicating illiquid or unreliable conditions. Orderbook is empty, with no bids or asks, suggesting minimal market participation. While RSI levels are oversold (36-41), this alone is not sufficient without volume confirmation or trend alignment. No clear support/resistance levels from the provided chart history, and Hyperliquid-specific factors (funding, OI) are neutral. Risk/reward is unfavorable due to high volatility (ATR 1.83%) and bearish momentum. Confluence score of 2 falls below the minimum threshold of 4 for a trade setup. In such environments, preserving capital by avoiding trades is prudent.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases significantly with bullish confluence (e.g., RSI divergence, CVD positive), consider long entry near support. If bearish trend continues with volume, avoid until stabilization.",
  "if_breakout": "If price breaks above key resistance (e.g., EMA 20 at 114657.55) with volume, reassess for long setup. If breaks below 111406.00 with volume, potential for further declines; avoid shorts due to liquidity issues.",
  "if_ranging": "If price consolidates between 111406.00 and 113570.00 with improved volume, watch for breakout patterns; otherwise, hold due to choppy conditions."
}

## 📍 Monitoring Points
- Volume spikes across timeframes
- Orderbook depth and imbalance changes
- RSI and MACD for divergence or momentum shifts
- Funding rate and OI trends for Hyperliquid signals
- Price action around 111406.00 (support) and 113570.00 (resistance)

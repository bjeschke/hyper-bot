## 🧠 AI Reasoning Process

### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.85
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 4/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - RSI on 1h at 37.2 indicates oversold conditions
  - Price near recent low of $111,360, potential support
  - 24h price change -2.31% may lead to mean reversion

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Price below all key EMAs (20/50/200)
  - ADX 58 with -DI > +DI confirms strong bearish trend
  - Supertrend bearish signal
  - %B position -0.17 below Bollinger Lower Band
  - Extremely low volume across timeframes
  - No orderbook data, indicating liquidity issues

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Bearish trend dominance with oversold conditions, but low liquidity and data quality prevent reliable trading setups.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence and high risks from poor data quality. Analysis reveals a strong bearish trend with price below all EMAs, high ADX, and bearish Supertrend, but oversold RSI on 1h and 4h timeframes suggests potential for a bounce. However, critical issues include extremely low volume (e.g., $0 on 1m/5m/15m, $1 on 1h) and absent orderbook data, indicating low liquidity and high slippage risk. No clear support/resistance breaks or volume confirmation, and derivatives data (funding, OI) is neutral. Without minimum 4 strong confluence factors, trading is inadvisable. Risk/reward is unfavorable; any entry would lack clear stop-loss levels and targets due to data gaps.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If price breaks below $111,360 with volume, bearish trend strengthens; consider short setups only if confluence improves. If price bounces above EMA 20 with volume, reassess for long opportunities.",
  "if_breakout": "If price breaks above $114,050 (1h high) with high volume, trend may shift to bullish; wait for confirmation from indicators like RSI >50 and MACD turning positive.",
  "if_ranging": "If price consolidates between $111,360 and $114,050, avoid trading until clear breakout with volume confirmation; focus on preserving capital."
}

## 📍 Monitoring Points
- Watch for volume increase above average levels
- Monitor RSI on 1h and 4h for cross above 50
- Check for orderbook data updates and liquidity improvement
- Observe price action around $111,360 support and $114,050 resistance
- Track funding rate changes and open interest for derivatives signals

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

INSUFFICIENT DATA AND CONFLUENCE FOR TRADING DECISION. The market shows extremely low liquidity with near-zero volume across all timeframes, making any price action unreliable. Technical indicators are mixed: EMAs show no clear alignment (bearish bias with price below all but weak structure), ADX at 15.8 indicates ranging market, RSI neutral (40.6-48.8), and MACD completely flat. Volume is critically low (0.51x average) with no orderbook depth - this violates minimum liquidity requirements. The price is trading in a tight range between recent low $1095.80 and high $1120.50, but without volume confirmation, this range cannot be trusted. Market regime is clearly RANGING with weak strength. With only 1 confluence point (weak momentum) out of required 4+, no clear risk/reward setup exists. The absence of orderbook data and derivatives activity (OI $0) makes Hyperliquid-specific analysis impossible. HOLD is the only prudent decision until better data and market conditions emerge.

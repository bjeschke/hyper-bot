### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.70
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 3/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - Minor price recovery from 24h low of $111,367.00
  - RSI values in oversold territory (e.g., 1h RSI 37.6)

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Price below all EMAs indicating bearish alignment
  - ADX 58.0 with -DI > +DI confirming strong bearish trend
  - Supertrend signal bearish
  - 24h price change of -1.97%
  - Lack of volume confirmation across timeframes

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Bearish trend with illiquidity undermining any reliable trading signals

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

After thorough analysis, the decision is to HOLD due to insufficient confluence and high risks from illiquidity. The market shows a bearish trend with price below all EMAs, high ADX (58.0), and -DI dominating +DI, but momentum indicators like RSI are low without confirmation, and volume is virtually non-existent, making signals unreliable. Orderbook and microstructure data are absent, indicating extreme illiquidity that could lead to high slippage and execution issues. Although there is a minor price recovery from the 24h low, the lack of volume support and clear risk/reward setup (e.g., no defined stop-loss or take-profit levels with confidence) outweighs any potential entry. The dominant narrative is a bearish trend with no compelling reason to enter a trade, as confluence falls below the minimum threshold of 4 factors.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases and price breaks above key resistance (e.g., EMA 20 at $114,527.95) with confirmation, consider a long setup. If price breaks below $111,367.00 with volume, a short setup may emerge.",
  "if_breakout": "If a clear breakout occurs with volume, wait for retest and confluence from multiple indicators before entering.",
  "if_ranging": "If price consolidates between $111,367.00 and $114,050.00, avoid trading until a clear trend direction is established with volume."
}

## 📍 Monitoring Points
- Watch for any increase in volume across timeframes
- Monitor price action around EMAs and key levels like $111,367.00 (support) and $114,050.00 (resistance)
- Check for updates in orderbook data and funding rates
- Observe if RSI divergences or MACD signals develop with volume confirmation

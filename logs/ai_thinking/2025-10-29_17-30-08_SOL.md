**Bearish Factors**:
  - ADX 44.0 with -DI > +DI indicating bearish trend

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence for any trade direction. Market regime is TRENDING_BEAR with strong ADX (44.0) and bearish DI crossover, but momentum is mixed with RSI neutral and MACD flat. Volume is consistently low, indicating lack of participant interest, and microstructure data is absent or neutral, providing no edge. Key levels: recent high $203.50 and low $193.47, with current price $196.21 in a range. No clear breakout or breakdown patterns identified from the sparse chart history. Risk/reward is unfavorable without defined stop-loss and take-profit levels based on technical structure. Hyperliquid-specific factors like funding and OI are neutral, offering no additional bias. Overall, confidence is low (0.3) as confluence score of 3 falls below the minimum threshold of 4 for a trade.

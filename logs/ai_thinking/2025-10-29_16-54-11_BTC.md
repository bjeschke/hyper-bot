### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.80
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 2/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - Price 0.9% above 24h low ($111406.00), potential support
  - OBV shows uptrend (though volume-low)
  - RSI on 1h/4h not oversold, room for bounce

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Strong bearish trend: ADX 65.4, -DI > +DI, Supertrend bearish
  - Price below all EMAs and VWAP
  - 24h price change -2.03%
  - Extremely low volume, lack of participation
  - No orderbook liquidity or microstructure signals

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Bearish trend with low liquidity and no confirmation for reversal or continuation; market in uncertain state with high risk of false signals.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence and high uncertainty. Market regime is TRENDING_BEAR with strong ADX (65.4) and bearish DI crossover (-DI > +DI), but low volume and missing data undermine setup quality. Trend analysis shows price below key EMAs and VWAP, supporting bearish bias, yet momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) are neutral without clear signals. Volume is critically low across timeframes (e.g., 1h volume $1), rendering OBV and CVD trends unreliable. Microstructure lacks orderbook depth, funding signals, or liquidation clusters, and no clear chart patterns (e.g., breakouts, flags) emerge from the sparse price history. Risk/reward is unfavorable without defined support/resistance for stop-loss and take-profit placement. Hyperliquid-specific factors (funding neutral, OI $0) offer no edge. Overall, confidence is low (0.3) as confluence score of 2 falls below the minimum threshold of 4 for a trade, and the bearish regime suggests caution. Alternative: Wait for volume increase or clearer technical confirmations.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases with bullish confluence (e.g., break above EMA 20 with high volume), consider long setup with stop below recent low.",
  "if_breakout": "If price breaks below $111406.00 with volume, bearish trend strengthens; avoid longs and watch for short opportunities after confirmation.",
  "if_ranging": "If price consolidates between $111406-$113770 with rising volume, wait for breakout direction before trading."

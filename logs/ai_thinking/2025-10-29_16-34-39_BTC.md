### Market Regime Analysis
**Primary Regime**: TRENDING_BEAR
**Strength**: 0.70
**Regime Aligned**: False

### Confluence Analysis

- **Trend Factors**: []
- **Momentum Factors**: []
- **Volume Factors**: []
- **Microstructure Factors**: []
- **Total Confluence**: 3/10


### Key Factors

**Bullish Factors**:
  - RSI oversold on 5m and 1h timeframes
  - Price near 24h low ($111,406), potential support
  - OBV showing uptrend (though volume is low)

**Bearish Factors**:
  - Price below all EMAs (20,50,200)
  - ADX high (65.4) with -DI > +DI, strong bearish trend
  - Supertrend bearish signal
  - Low volume across timeframes, indicating weak participation
  - Price down 3.64% over 24h, lower highs from $116,402

**Dominant Narrative**:
  - Strong bearish trend with oversold conditions, but critically low volume and lack of microstructure data make any trade high-risk; patience required for clearer signals.

## 💭 Detailed Reasoning

HOLD decision due to insufficient confluence and high risks. TREND: Bearish dominance with price below all key EMAs, strong ADX (65.4), and -DI exceeding +DI, indicating sustained selling pressure. However, price is near 24h low ($111,406), which could act as support, but no reversal signals. MOMENTUM: RSI oversold on shorter timeframes, but in a strong downtrend, this alone is unreliable; MACD flat shows no momentum shift. VOLUME: Critically low volume (e.g., 1h volume $1) suggests lack of participant conviction, making any signals untrustworthy; OBV uptrend is contradicted by abysmal volume. MICROSTRUCTURE: Absence of orderbook data, neutral funding, and no OI changes render Hyperliquid-specific factors non-actionable. Overall, confluence score of 3 falls below the minimum threshold of 4, and liquidity issues (volume near zero, no orderbook depth) pose execution risks. In such conditions, preserving capital by avoiding trades is prudent.

## 🔮 Alternative Scenarios
{
  "if_invalidated": "If volume increases with bullish reversal (e.g., break above EMA 20 with high volume), consider long setups; if bearish continuation below $111,406, wait for stabilization.",
  "if_breakout": "If price breaks above $113,570 with volume, reassess for long opportunities; if breaks below $111,406, monitor for short setups only if volume confirms.",
  "if_ranging": "If price consolidates between $111,406 and $113,570 with improved volume, look for breakout/breakdown confluences before trading."

## 📍 Monitoring Points
- Volume spikes across timeframes for signal reliability
- Price action around key levels: $111,406 (support) and $113,570 (resistance)
- RSI and MACD for momentum shifts or divergences
- Orderbook and microstructure data if available
- Funding rate and OI changes for Hyperliquid-specific cues
